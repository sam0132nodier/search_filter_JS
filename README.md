## Search and Filter Pure JavaScript

![Project image](./img/view.png)

This is a search and filter that extends the one that I did last time which only used `datalist`. Click [here](https://github.com/sam0132nodier/search-filter-HTML_CSS).

This one is using JavaScript is more effient considering the way that it shows the user all items available to and as long as you start typing the matching words are only going to remain in the list. When you start deleting, the removed words will be back in the list.

Try it, it's supper easy. Any question [email me](sam0132nodier@gmail.com).

Thank you!
